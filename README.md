# Coding Knowledge Quiz
This quiz was written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Additionally, the quiz employs Bootstrap. 

The purpose of the quiz is to test the knowledge of the user when it comes to coding questions. There are 4 total questions and the user has exactly sixty seconds to complete all four questions correctly. If a question is answered incorrectly, the program will deduct 10 seconds from the timer and the user will be unable to move forward in the game until the question is answered correctly.

At the end of the quiz, the user will be requested to save identifying initials into the program, which will post with their score. The objective of this is to allow users to compete against one another, as well as themselves, to get the highest score.
